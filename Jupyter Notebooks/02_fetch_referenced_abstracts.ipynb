         "The use of the Martius graft, a labial fibro-fatty tissue graft, is described as an adjunctive technique in the repair of 37 complex fistulas in 35 patients. The graft was used to repair three groups of patients with non-radiation-induced vesicovaginal fistulas: 12 patients with large (greater than 4 cm) obstetric fistulas, six patients with obstetric fistulas that caused urethral sloughing, and six patients with recurrent obstetric or post-hysterectomy fistulas. Five other patients had radiation-induced fistulas, and six others had rectovaginal fistulas. The overall success rate was 86.5%. Anatomical studies undertaken of the graft in a cadaver demonstrated that it is composed of fibroadipose tissue from the labium majus, and not from the bulbocavernosus muscle. It receives its blood supply anteriorly from the external pudendal artery and posteriorly from the internal pudendal artery. These vessels form a plexus within the graft. The prominence of fibrous tissue in this fibroadipose tissue arises from a superficial tunic of fibrous tissue similar to the tunica dartos in the male, as well as from the considerable fibrous septa within the adipose tissue itself. Although the labial graft used today differs from that originally described by Heinrich Martius, it remains a safe, simple, and helpful technique in difficult fistula repairs.",

         "INTRODUCTION: The impact of obstetric vesicovaginal fistula (VVF), which continues to occur among women in developing countries, can severely affect the health of the women while the condition persists. This study was designed to discover the effect of successful VVF repair on affected women's quality of life. METHODS: A comparison of the quality of life of a cross-section of women who had VVF was carried out before and 6 months after successful repair. Quality of life was assessed using the WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-BREF Questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 150 women studied, only 20% felt satisfied with their general state of health and quality of life before the repair, while this increased to 90% following successful repair (highly statistically significant at p<0.000). In the physical health domain, the mean quality of life score was 67.9 +/- 4.4 before and 69.3 +/- 3.4 after successful repair (p<0.01). In the mental health domain, the mean quality of life score was 32.4 +/- 8.7 before and 74.7 +/- 3.2 after successful repair (p<0.005). In the social health domain, the mean score was 20.2 +/- 2.7 before and 69.7 +/- 2.3 after successful repair (p<0.001). In the environment domain, the mean score of quality of life was 60.3 +/- 4.3 before repair and 59.7 +/- 2.7 after successful repair (comparable at p<0.2). CONCLUSION: Successful repair of VVF is associated with significant improvement in the multidimensional quality of life among affected women.",

         "Association of Low Socioeconomic Status With Premature Coronary Heart Disease in US Adults.",
         "IMPORTANCE: Individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) bear a disproportionate share of the coronary heart disease (CHD) burden, and CHD remains the leading cause of mortality in low-income US counties. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the excess CHD burden among individuals in the United States with low SES and the proportions attributable to traditional risk factors and to other factors associated with low SES. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This computer simulation study used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, a model of CHD and stroke incidence, prevalence, and mortality among adults in the United States, to project the excess burden of early CHD. The proportion of this excess burden attributable to traditional CHD risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and high body mass index) compared with the proportion attributable to other risk factors associated with low SES was estimated. Model inputs were derived from nationally representative US data and cohort studies of incident CHD. All US adults aged 35 to 64 years, stratified by SES, were included in the simulations. EXPOSURES: Low SES was defined as income below 150% of the federal poverty level or educational level less than a high school diploma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Premature (before age 65 years) myocardial infarction (MI) rates and CHD deaths. RESULTS: Approximately 31.2 million US adults aged 35 to 64 years had low SES, of whom approximately 16 million (51.3%) were women. Compared with individuals with higher SES, both men and women in the low-SES group had double the rate of MIs (men: 34.8 [95% uncertainty interval (UI), 31.0-38.8] vs 17.6 [95% UI, 16.0-18.6]; women: 15.1 [95% UI, 13.4-16.9] vs 6.8 [95% UI, 6.3-7.4]) and CHD deaths (men: 14.3 [95% UI, 13.0-15.7] vs 7.6 [95% UI, 7.3-7.9]; women: 5.6 [95% UI, 5.0-6.2] vs 2.5 [95% UI, 2.3-2.6]) per 10 000 person-years. A higher burden of traditional CHD risk factors in adults with low SES explained 40% of these excess events; the remaining 60% of these events were attributable to other factors associated with low SES. Among a simulated cohort of 1.3 million adults with low SES who were 35 years old in 2015, the model projected that 250 000 individuals (19%) will develop CHD by age 65 years, with 119 000 (48%) of these CHD cases occurring in excess of those expected for individuals with higher SES. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggested that, for approximately one-quarter of US adults aged 35 to 64 years, low SES was substantially associated with early CHD burden. Although biomedical interventions to modify traditional risk factors may decrease the disease burden, disparities by SES may remain without addressing SES itself.",

         "Long-term benefit of primary angioplasty as compared with thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction.",
         "BACKGROUND: As compared with thrombolytic therapy, primary coronary angioplasty results in a higher rate of patency of the infarct-related coronary artery, lower rates of stroke and reinfarction, and higher in-hospital or 30-day survival rates. However, the comparative long-term efficacy of these two approaches has not been carefully studied. METHODS: We randomly assigned a total of 395 patients with acute myocardial infarction to treatment with angioplasty or intravenous streptokinase. Clinical information was collected for a mean (+/-SD) of 5+/-2 years, and medical charges associated with the two treatments were compared. RESULTS: A total of 194 patients were assigned to undergo primary angioplasty, and 201 to receive streptokinase. Mortality was 13 percent in the angioplasty group, as compared with 24 percent in the streptokinase group (relative risk, 0.54; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.87). Nonfatal reinfarction occurred in 6 percent and 22 percent of the two groups, respectively (relative risk, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.52). The combined incidence of death and nonfatal reinfarction was also lower among patients assigned to angioplasty than among those assigned to streptokinase, with a relative risk of 0.13 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.37) for early events (within the first 30 days) and a relative risk of 0.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.91) for late events (after 30 days). The rates of readmission for heart failure and ischemia were also lower among patients in the angioplasty group than among patients in the streptokinase group. Total medical charges per patient were lower in the angioplasty group (16,090 dollars) than in the streptokinase group (16,813 dollars, P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During five years of follow-up, primary coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction was associated with lower rates of early and late death and nonfatal reinfarction, fewer hospital readmissions for ischemia or heart failure, and lower total medical charges than treatment with intravenous streptokinase.",

         "BACKGROUND: Current guidelines suggest that, for patients at moderate risk of death from unstable coronary-artery disease, either an interventional strategy (angiography followed by revascularisation) or a conservative strategy (ischaemia-driven or symptom-driven angiography) is appropriate. We aimed to test the hypothesis that an interventional strategy is better than a conservative strategy in such patients. METHODS: We did a randomised multicentre trial of 1810 patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (mean age 62 years, 38% women). Patients were assigned an early intervention or conservative strategy. The antithrombin agent in both groups was enoxaparin. The co-primary endpoints were a combined rate of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or refractory angina at 4 months; and a combined rate of death or non-fatal myocardial infarction at 1 year. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: At 4 months, 86 (9.6%) of 895 patients in the intervention group had died or had a myocardial infarction or refractory angina, compared with 133 (14.5%) of 915 patients in the conservative group (risk ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85, p=0.001). This difference was mainly due to a halving of refractory angina in the intervention group. Death or myocardial infarction was similar in both treatment groups at 1 year (68 [7.6%] vs 76 [8.3%], respectively; risk ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.67-1.25, p=0.58). Symptoms of angina were improved and use of antianginal medications significantly reduced with the interventional strategy (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: In patients presenting with unstable coronary-artery disease, an interventional strategy is preferable to a conservative strategy, mainly because of the halving of refractory or severe angina, and with no increased risk of death or myocardial infarction.",
