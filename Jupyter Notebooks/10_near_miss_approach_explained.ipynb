    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate how well an LLM can screen papers for systematic reviews, we need:\n",
    "- **Positive examples**: Papers that SHOULD be included (easy — these are cited in the review)\n",
    "- **Negative examples**: Papers that SHOULD be excluded (harder — we don't have a list of \"rejected\" papers)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Near-Miss Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using random papers (too easy to distinguish), we use papers from **related reviews** that were NOT included in the target review. These are \"near-misses\" — papers that are topically similar but don't meet the specific inclusion criteria.\n",
