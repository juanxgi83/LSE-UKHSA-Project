         "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. To assess the efficacy of aldose reductase inhibitors in the prevention, reversal or delay in the progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The Cochrane Diabetes Group's database was searched and the citation lists of identified trials and previous reviews checked. Investigators identified as active in the field were approached for overlooked studies. Randomised controlled trials of aldose reductase inhibitors versus placebo, no treatment or other treatment in diabetic patients with or without clinical neuropathy. Nerve conduction velocity was the only end point measured in all trials. Treatment effect was evaluated in terms of nerve conduction velocity mean difference in median and peroneal motor and median and sural sensory nerves. 19 trials, testing 4 different aldose reductase inhibitors for between 4 to 208 weeks duration (median 24 weeks), met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. A small but statistically significant reduction in decline of median and peroneal motor nerve conduction velocities was present in the treated group when compared to the control group (weighted mean 0.66 m/s 95% CI 0.18-1.14 m/s and 0.53 m/s 95% CI 0.02-1.04m/s respectively). No clear benefit of aldose reductase inhibitor treatment was observed in either of the sensory nerves. Although aldose reductase inhibitor treatment has been demonstrated to diminish the reduction in motor nerve conduction velocity, the clinical relevance of such a change in this outcome measure is uncertain. There was no effect in terms of this outcome measure in the smaller sensory fibres, degeneration of which is primarily responsible for the most common neuropathic syndrome associated with diabetes, that of severe pain and loss of sensation in the extremity leading in some cases to ulceration and eventual amputation.",

The objective of this review was to assess the effect of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention in people with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and a previous transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic stroke. The reviewer searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register and contacted trialists. Randomised trials comparing an antiplatelet agent with placebo or open control in people with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and a previous transient ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke. One reviewer extracted the data. One trial was included, in which 300 milligrams of aspirin per day was compared with placebo. This review includes 404 aspirin-treated patients and 378 placebo patients in total. The mean follow-up was 2.3 years. No difference was shown between aspirin and placebo in the annual rate of all vascular events, including vascular death, recurrent stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic), myocardial infarction, and systemic embolism. The odds ratio was 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 1.14, or 15% of those receiving aspirin versus 19% for those given placebo. Aspirin may prevent 40 vascular events (of all types) per 1000 patients treated for one year. There was a non-significant reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke from 12% to 10% per year (odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.24). The incidence of major bleeding events, requiring hospitalisation, blood transfusion or surgical treatment, was low (0.9% per year for aspirin versus 0.7% for placebo). Aspirin may reduce the risk of vascular events in people with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, but the effect shown in the single trial was not statistically significant.",

         "Oligo-astheno-teratospermia (sperm of low concentration, reduced motility and increased abnormal morphology) of unknown cause is common and the need for treatment is felt by patients and doctors alike. As a result, a variety of empirical, non-specific treatments have been used in an attempt to improve semen characteristics and fertility. One suggested treatment for idiopathic oligo- and/or asthenospermia is the administration of kallikrein (kallidinogenase), a kinin-releasing enzyme (or kininogenase). Although the kinin system may also be involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis in vivo, a clear mechanism of action is missing. Multiple suggestions on how an increase in kinin levels in the genital tract influences spermatogenesis at the testicular levels have been made by various authors. To determine whether treatment of the male with drugs enhancing kinin levles increases pregnancy rates among couples where failure to conceive has been attributed to idiopathic oligo- and/or asthenospermia. Effects on sperm parameters and sex hormones were studied as secondary outcomes. The Cochrane Subfertility Review Group specialised register of controlled trials was searched. SIxteen RCTs on the therapeutic use of androgens (clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen) in subfertile men were identified. Six trials were excluded. All data were extracted by the first author. Unclear issues were resolved by consensus with the senior author (RL). Data was combined for meta-analysis using Peto odds ratios for dichotomous data or weighted mean difference for continuous data. X AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review does not provide conclusive proof of effectiveness. The benefit on pregnancy rates suggested by observational studies and low quality controlled trials is not confirmed by more rigorous trials. A modest effect on sperm motility is technically possible but was again not confirmed in the better quality trials. The clinical significance of a modest increase in sperm motility is uncertain. Untill effectiveness is proven, kallikrein should only be used in the context of clinical trials.",

         "There may be an association between recurrent miscarriage and abnormal hormone function in the follicular phase. Human chorionic gonadotrophin may play a role in preventing miscarriages. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of human chorionic gonadotrophin administration during early pregnancy on the risk of miscarriage in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched. Date of last search: 9 January 1998. Randomised trials of human chorionic gonadotrophin compared with placebo or no treatment in women who have had two or more miscarriages. Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by one reviewer. Four trials involving 180 women were included. The trials were of variable quality. Human chorionic gonadotrophin was associated with a reduced risk of miscarriage for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage (odds ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.52). This result should be interpreted cautiously because the apparent effect is greatly influenced by the two methodologically weaker studies. There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin during pregnancy in order to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of unexplained recurrent spontaneous miscarriage.",

         "Elevation of endogenous LH levels may result in premature luteinization. This may also be associated with the increased rate of spontaneous abortion. Gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) used prior to human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG/FSH) administration may improve the outcome of ovulation induction. To assess if GnRHa pre-treatment plus FSH/hMG increase the rate of clinical pregnancy and/or decrease the rate of spontaneous abortion in women with WHO group two ovulatory dysfunction, compared with hMG/FSH alone. The Cochrane Subfertility Review Group specialised register of controlled trials was searched. All relevant published and unpublished RCTs were selected. Three RCTs were identified comparing these two approaches. A diverse search strategy was employed, including hand-search of 43 core journals from 1966 to the present, bibliographies of relevant trials, MEDLINE database, abstracts from North American and European meetings and contact with authors of relevant papers. Relevant data were extracted independently by two reviewers using the standardised data extraction sheet. Validity was assessed in terms of method of randomisation, completeness of follow-up, presence or absence of crossover and co-intervention. Two by two tables were generated for all relevant outcomes. Odds ratios were generated using the Peto modified Mantel-Haenszel technique. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using by two. Studies were clinically and statistically homogenous. Common odds ratios for pregnancy per treatment cycle and moderate to severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) were 1.50 (0.72-3.12) and 1.40 (0.5-3.92) respectively. These studies are too small to clearly demonstrate clinically significant differences in pregnancy rate between the two approaches. However, data from IVF studies suggest that there may be an increased risk of OHSS associated with GnRHa use. In the absence of evidence suggesting a benefit of GnRHa augmentation for PCOS, it should not be recommended as a standard treatment for this patient group. Further studies assessing live birth and OHSS rates are warranted.",
