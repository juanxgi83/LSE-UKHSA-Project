# Executive Summary

*[Add executive summary here]*

# Introduction

## Background

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is interested in evaluating the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) in screening paper abstracts for inclusion in systematic reviews of health policy topics. Systematic reviews attempt to identify, appraise and synthesise evidence to answer specific research questions. This makes them a valuable tool for UKHSA policy analysts seeking a complete and unbiased review of relevant evidence to help answer health policy questions.

These reviews are normally created and updated by volunteer researchers, who follow detailed protocols to increase consistency and reduce bias. Volunteers must identify and evaluate hundreds of potentially relevant papers for inclusion before even commencing a systematic review. This labour-intensive process could potentially be automated by LLMs, whose ability to intelligently handle text data could make them ideally suited to this task, if they can make decisions about paper inclusion at least as accurately as human reviewers.

## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to analyse the effectiveness of automating the selection process for systematic reviews in the field of health policy by using LLMs. The analysis optimises, measures, and reports the accuracy of LLMs in accomplishing this task within an automated systematic review pipeline.

## Report Structure

This report is structured as follows:

1. **Literature Review** - Review of existing research on LLM applications in systematic reviews
2. **Data & Methodology** - Description of data sources, processing pipeline, and evaluation approach
3. **Results** - Presentation of model performance and comparative analysis
4. **Discussion** - Interpretation of findings and implications
5. **Conclusions & Recommendations** - Summary and actionable recommendations for UKHSA

# Data & Methodology

## Data Sources

### Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Cochrane Library is one of the primary organisations engaged in the creation of systematic reviews. Their database includes thousands of high-quality systematic reviews on many health-related topics. The large number of high-quality systematic reviews makes the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews a good candidate for a source of "ground truth" in our evaluation of LLMs' application to the creation of these reviews.

### PubMed Database

PubMed is a database maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. It constitutes an index of biomedical literature, compiling citations and abstracts from journals and databases, e.g. the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR).

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used to assess model performance:

### Precision

The percentage of correctly predicted positives:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
$$

### Recall

The percentage of real positives that were identified correctly:

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
$$

### F1 Score

The harmonic mean of precision and recall:

$$
F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
$$

### Cohen's Kappa

A statistic that gauges agreement among raters for categorical items, adjusting for agreement by chance:

$$
\kappa = \frac{p_o-p_e}{1-p_e}
$$

where:

- $p_o$ is the observed agreement proportion among raters
- $p_e$ is the expected chance agreement proportion
